Big Data Pipeline
Traffic congestion poses a challenge whenever the demand for transportation system is outspaced by its capacity.It contributes to typical day-to-day problems like late appointments, wear-and-tear of vehicles and emotional stress. Studies also suggest that traffic congestion impacts on the economy (in the form productivity loss), the road surface integrity and the environment.
Project Objective:
Build big data processing pipeline to visualize real time Chicago traffic data. Data is retrieved from City of Chicago data portal via SODA API.The data is sent to Spark streaming using Kafka which is a high throughput messaging system and create dashboard in Power BI to visualize ,Time of the day and levels of congestion based on origins and destination.
